## 🔍 Introduction

Super-resolution is the process of reconstructing a high-resolution image from a low-resolution one. In this project, an **Auto-Encoder** is used to learn the mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images, producing sharper and more detailed outputs.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/autoencoder-superresolution.git
    cd autoencoder-superresolution
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --dataset /path/to/your/dataset --epochs 50
```
After training, the super-resolved images will be saved in the outputs/ directory.
